      <h2>Welcome, cannibal!</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <b>Forensic Cannibalism</b>. Expect useless software, schizo-rants, and entire articles complaining about stupid things I see online. Forensic cannibalism is <i>the act of metaphorically defiling the grave of an idea in order to satisfy a morbid craving for obsolete comfort.</i> <a href="https://groups.spacehey.com/olderbrothercore">This</a> is a prime example of forensic cannibalism. Someone born years after the days of Y2K larping as an early-2000's kid, and in the process, soiling the idea of what that era even looked like.<br><br>This site was named the way it was since it could ironically be considered forensic cannibalism against old websites. Though, I really just like making simple sites without animations and requests to steal your info flooding your screen.
