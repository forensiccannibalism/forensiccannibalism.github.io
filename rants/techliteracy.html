      <h2>Tech Illiterate People Should Be Banned From The Internet</h2>
      <p>For some reason everyone under the age of 30 thinks they're immune to being lied to online. They see old people falling for stupid shit like an AI generated African kid building Jesus out of coke cans, and they think thats as far as it goes. I can't believe I just saw over 1 million people falling for a TikTok of a "North Korean sneaking footage". First, I'm just gonna lay out some reasons that it's a plain fucking stupid claim:<br><br>*VPNs literally just don't work there<br>*Why would he conveniently discover TikTok and decide <b>that</b> is the best place to post valuable & illegal footage<br>*He would have to learn the English alphabet to make an account<br>*He apparently owns the only phone in the world that records at 144p and 60fps<br>*We already have real footage from tourists<br><br>I've also prepared responses to any dumbass arguments you might have.</p>
      <h3>"But what if he's a higher-up who can use a VPN?"</h3>
      <p>VPNs aren't some fairy tale magic that hide everything you do. If someone is monitoring your network traffic, they're still gonna see that you're using a VPN. They just won't see what you access with the VPN. Anything like this would be found immediately no matter who was doing it, and definitely wouldn't last as long as it has.</p>
      <h3>"He probably found TikTok by searching for popular platforms, and it's a great place to post because it goes straight to the people!"</h3>
      <p>I can see how TikTok would be a good place to reach people fast, but only uploading it there is pure retardation. All important footage like that will end up lost forever within a year. Upload it to archive.org or (at the bare minimum) YouTube and now we're talking. Now if anyone discovered TikTok from searching for popular platforms, they would instantly disregard it for these very reasons, and for the fact that it's literally Chinese (China is repeatedly shown to help the DPRK with stopping situations like this).</p>
      <h3>"Maybe the footage is low quality because he compressed it!"</h3>
      <p>The only reason he would compress the video is to be able to upload it faster to reduce the possibility of being caught. I already explained that <i>any</i> uploads will be found no matter what you do, but even then there's more wrong with this claim. If he uploaded the video to a compressing utility online, that would mean he's uploaded the video more than originally intended. If we give him the benefit of the doubt and say he downloaded a small compressor program, once again any kind of downloads or uploads will be identified quickly.</p>
